## My Portfolio

## Description
- My goal was to create a portfolio from scratch using React.js. I found it to be challenging and rewarding! My side goals were making this portfolio employer ready and mobile first. I believe I have acheived my goals, and I look forward to building my portfolio by adding more projects thought-out my coding journey.
