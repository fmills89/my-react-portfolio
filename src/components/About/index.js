           ðŸ‘‹ Hello world! My name is Forrest and I am a 
            full stack developer or something close to it!
            I recently graduated from a Trilogy Bootcamp offered through UTSA's School of Data Science.
           </p>
           <p className='content'>
               Over the course of 6 months I have learned 
               the stack from front-end all the way to the back end.
