           ðŸ‘‹  My name is Forrest and I am a 
            full stack developer or something close to it!
            I recently graduated from a Trilogy Bootcamp offered through UTSA's School of Data Science.
            Over the course of 6 months I have learned 
            the stack from front-end all the way to the back end.
